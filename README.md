#  Fashion MNIST Classification Using Keras CNN

This project implements a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** using **Keras (standalone)** in **Python** to classify grayscale images from the **Fashion MNIST** dataset.

It includes:
- A CNN with **six layers**
- Training and evaluation on Fashion MNIST
- Predictions on **two test images** (numbered and visualized)
